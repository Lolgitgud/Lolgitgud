The account name comes from a Bloodborne meme. The backstory is that Bloodborne is a notoriously steep-learning-curve game. As a beginner, you are basically given a knife and sent off to kill giant monsters. Your character dies A LOT. There is no hand-holding and when you ask the community how you can kill the bosses you're just told to " just git gud". Observe, practice, and get better. To me that's how it feels when you join a new organization and are given a search box and sent off to handle the giant eldritch creature that is the data everyone's been dumping into Splunk. So I set out to create some trick weapons that could help others upgrade their character.
